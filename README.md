# Call-center-dashboard
The dashboard is a comprehensive Excel-based dashboard designed to evaluate and visualize the performance of individual call center representatives over a complete fiscal year. This dashboard aggregates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of calls handled, average handling time, call resolution rates, and the total revenue or earnings generated by each representative.

The purpose of the dashboard is to provide management and team leads with clear, data-driven insights into how each representative contributes to the overall success of the call center. By tracking performance across multiple dimensions, the dashboard enables better decision-making in areas such as workforce management, incentive planning, training needs, and individual performance assessments.

The dashboard includes several features such as interactive charts, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and formulas to support dynamic data updates and visual storytelling. Each representativeâ€™s data is broken down across time periods (monthly or quarterly), allowing for trend analysis and the identification of high or low performers throughout the year.

This file serves as an important resource for performance reviews, goal setting, and reward allocation. It can also be used to identify patterns in customer interactions, flag potential inefficiencies, and forecast future call center outcomes based on historical performance data.

Whether used by team supervisors, operations managers, or executives, the dashboard provides a high-level yet detailed snapshot of call center productivity and financial contribution at the individual level. It is well-suited for integration into larger reporting workflows or for presentation in strategic meetings.
